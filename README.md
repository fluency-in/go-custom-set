# Go: Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

The tests are written using the `testing` package in the standard library.

To run a test file use the `go test` command:

    go test
